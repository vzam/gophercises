Go has become one of the [most popular](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/workspace.md) programming languages. I have worked with go a couple of years ago, but I didn't continue practicing and so I have forgotten most of it. 

Since it is gaining relevance in the back-end area (which is exactly my domain), I will attend the [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) course, and upload my solutions here.
